# Docker Project – Nginx Static Website

## Overview

This project demonstrates the containerization of a simple static web page using Docker and Nginx. The application serves a custom HTML page through an Nginx web server running inside a Docker container.

This project was created as part of my Docker learning journey to gain hands-on experience with:

* Docker image creation
* Dockerfile configuration
* Container deployment
* Nginx web server
* Git and GitHub integration

## Project Structure

```text
docker-project/
├── Dockerfile
├── index.html
└── README.md
```

---

## Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM nginx
COPY index.html /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html
```

### Explanation

* `FROM nginx` – Uses the official Nginx image as the base image
* `COPY index.html /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html` – Copies the custom web page into the default Nginx web root.

---

## Web Page Content

The application serves a simple HTML page:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Ashwini Docker Project</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello from Ashwini's Docker Container!</h1>
    <p>Day 4 - Docker Learning Journey</p>
</body>
</html>
```

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure the following are installed:

* Docker
* Git

Verify installation:

```bash
docker --version
git --version
```

---

## Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ashwini-dudu/Docker-project.git

cd Docker-project
```

---

## Build the Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t ashwini-nginx .
```

---

## Run the Container

```bash
docker run -d -p 80:80 --name ashwini-web ashwini-nginx
```

---

## Verify Container Status

```bash
docker ps
```

Expected output should show the container running and port 80 exposed.

---

## Access the Application

### Local Machine

```text
http://localhost
```

### AWS EC2 Instance

```text
http://<EC2-Public-IP>
```

Example:

```text
http://13.xxx.xxx.xxx
```

## CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions

This project includes a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically runs on every push or pull request to the main branch.

The workflow performs the following steps:

1. Checks out the repository.
2. Builds the Docker image.
3. Runs the Docker container.
4. Validates the website using curl.
5. Stops the container after validation.

This helped me understand Continuous Integration, Docker image validation, and automated application testing.

---
## Useful Docker Commands

### View Running Containers

```bash
docker ps
```

### View Container Logs

```bash
docker logs ashwini-web
```

### Stop Container

```bash
docker stop ashwini-web
```

### Start Container

```bash
docker start ashwini-web
```

### Remove Container

```bash
docker rm -f ashwini-web
```

### Remove Image

```bash
docker rmi ashwini-nginx
```

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I gained practical experience with:

* Building Docker images
* Working with Dockerfiles
* Running and managing containers
* Port mapping
* Serving static content using Nginx
* Version control using Git and GitHub
